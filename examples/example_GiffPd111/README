Here each matching combination of :code:`Pd_reac*.csv`, :code:`Pd_comp*.csv` and 
:code:`theta_*_Pd.csv` corresponds to a snapshot of the reaction network during 
the kinetic simulation carried out using AMUSE. The :code:`base_graph.dot` is a 
previously generated .dot file to facilitate the constant node positioning for 
the generation of a GIF. 

To quickly execute the example and produce the final GIF, run:

python run.py

In this script several steps have been automated: 

1) The generation of all the .dot files form the .csv files using rnets
2) Enforcing constant positions of the nodes in the final pngs through a 
combination of dot and neato
3) Combination of all the generated .png files into a single GIF.
