This folder contains all the files required to generate the Figure 4 and 8: 

Runner to generate in a straightforward way Figure 4 without colorbar (ideal for Windows users): 'run.py'

To execute this script type:

python run.py

The inputs and process followed by 'run.py' is the following: 

IMPORTANT NOTE: This process was generated in Linux. Some modifications, particularly for setting the paths to the inputs and outputs, might be required for Windows users.

Input from AMUSE (see https://github.com/LopezGroup-ICIQ/amuse):'Pd_g.mkm','rm.mkm','theta.csv'

Parser to generate the rNets required files from the AMUSE inputs: 'parser_visual.py' 

rNets input generated using 'parser_visual.py': 'Pd_comp.csv', 'Pd_reac.csv'

To generate the rNets input for Figure 4 type:

python parser_visual.py -outfname_comp Pd_comp.csv -outfname_rx ./assets/Pd_reac.csv -in_comp ./assets/Pd_g.mkm -in_rx ./assets/rm.mkm -in_theta noc

This action will generate the 'Pd_comp.csv' and 'Pd_reac.csv' files, containing the reactions and the energetics of the reaction network.

To generate the rNets input for Figure 8 type:

python parser_visual.py -outfname_comp Pd_comp.csv -outfname_rx Pd_reac.csv -in_comp ./assets/Pd_g.mkm -in_rx ./assets/rm.mkm -in_theta ./assets/theta.csv

To generate the Figures, once rNets is installed, type:

python -m rnets -cf Pd_comp.csv -rf Pd_reac.csv -o reaction_network.dot
dot -Tpng reaction_network.dot -o reaction_network.png

NOTE: To generate the theta.csv file, use AMUSE, available on https://github.com/LopezGroup-ICIQ/amuse. In the tutorial folder (as for an example), open a jupyter-notebook or make a script and type:

import numpy as np

import os, sys
from mkm import MKM

#Generate the model
model = MKM(“PdModel”, <PATH_TO_rm.mkm>, <PATH_TO_Pd_g.mkm>)

#Perform the kinetic run
#T=573 K, P=5e6 Pa, ratio CO2:H2 = 1:4
x = model.kinetic_run(573, 5e6, np.asarray([0.8, 0.2, 0,0,0]))
