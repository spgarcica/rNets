Command-line Examples
=======================

For the most basic usage of rNets through its command-line interface we recommend 
checking first the :doc:`../quick_start/basic_usage`. In this section, more 
detailed examples covering more detailed graph customization will be included. 

My first reaction Graph
-----------------------

In this example we will cover the generation of a graph with arbitrary energies

A thermodynamic Graph
---------------------

Here we will cover the generation of a graph colored by thermodynamic data

A kinetic Graph
---------------

Here we will cover the generation of a graph colored by concentrations and 
reaction rates. 

Using different energy units
----------------------------

Here we will cover how to prepare a chemical configuration different from the 
default one and how to use it.

Formatting our graph
--------------------

Here we will cover how to prepare a graph configuration different from the 
default one and how to use it.
